                    <p><span class="first-two-words">THE ALPHA</span> Tau chapter of Sigma Chi is home to the UNC brothers of Sigma Chi, located right near campus at 102 Fraternity Ct, Chapel Hill, NC. We pride ourselves in our unique, close knit brotherhood and our willingness to better ourselves as young men. The brothers in our chapter are involved in over 150 student organizations on campus, some even with leadership positions. Our fraternity consists of brothers with all types of majors and career goals, from business to computer science, to biology, just to name a few. 
                      UNC Sigma Chi is a brotherhood that we all love dearly. Joining Sigma Chi opens an opportunity for lifelong friendship. We tell every new member, “these are your friends for life, these are the guys who will be at your wedding,” because it's true. We pride ourselves in having a wide range of brothers from different backgrounds and different states. UNC Sigma Chi boasts the most out of state students and is one of the most diverse among IFC fraternities.

                    <p>Every fall, we host our weeklong philanthropy event called: Derby Days. During this week, we do various activities with sororities, including a powderpuff football tournament to cap it all off. All proceeds go to the Note in the Pocket Foundation, a charity that provides clothing to impoverished children in the triangle area. Not only do we love helping out and are dedicated to our studies, but we love to have some good nights out on the town as well. Come see us this fall.</p>
